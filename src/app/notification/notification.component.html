		<p>The Notifications API allows web pages to control the display of system notifications to the end user â€” these are outside
			the top-level browsing context viewport, so therefore can be displayed even the user has switched tabs or moved to a different
			app. The API is designed to be compatible with existing notification systems across different platforms.</p>
